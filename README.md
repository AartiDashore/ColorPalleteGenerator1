# Color Pallete Generator 1

This simple web application allows you to generate a color palette based on complementary colors.

## Usage
**Color Generation:** The Color Palette Generator uses the following logic to generate complementary colors:

- It randomly selects a base color.
- It calculates the complementary color by finding the color that is 180 degrees opposite on the color wheel.
- Both the base color and complementary color are displayed on the page as color boxes.

## Working

1. Users can click the "Generate Palette" button to generate a complementary color palette based on a randomly selected base color.
2. JavaScript functions getRandomColor, calculateComplementaryColor, and displayColor are used to generate and display colors dynamically.
3. The complementary color is calculated by finding the color that is 180 degrees opposite on the color wheel.
